# SpaceRacer

This is a racing game that I made during Metropolia's
course "Unity Game Development".

## Tools

- Unity engine
- Aseprite (The ugly menu texts :D )

## C# scripts

The scripts are the same scripts provided in course materials
with little adjustments by myself.

## Assets

## How to play?

- Use W, A, S, D to move the ship.
- There is 2 laps in the race.

My personal best is 0:58:59

## How to run?
